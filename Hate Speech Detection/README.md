Hate speech has been linked to the escalation of undesirable crimes, as individuals or groups may feel marginalized or disheartened by such discourse. Thus, it is imperative to keep an eye on user posts and remove hate speech before it gets out of control. 
However,with Twitter receiving over six hundred tweets per second and nearly 500 million tweets per day, manual filtering is virtually impossible. Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) technology has been utilized to construct an automated method for this challenge.
This DCNN model leverages tweet text alongside GloVe embedding vectors to capture the semantic nuances of tweets through convolution operations. The model outperformedprevious models in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving remarkable values of 0.97, 0.88, and 0.92 in the best-case scenario.
At the end of the project, I have made a user friendly Interface where the user can give inputs (texts) and detect whether the input is a hate speech or a non hate speech.
